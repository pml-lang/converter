Version 1.1.0 2021-01-14
========================

- New features:

    - New tags:
        - table_data: Simple table data defined as plain CSV text, and rendered as a table.
        - table: A table layout composed of rows and columns. Besides just text, each cell in the table can have complex content, including nested tables. Conceptually similar to a HTML table.
        - monospace: A paragraph in which whitespace is preserved, and a monospace font is used.
        - division: A division or section in the document. Similar to a 'div' tag in HTML.
        - span: An inline node typically used to render a HTML <span>...</span> inline element with a specific set of HTML attributes.

    - New attributes:
        - caption: a small text displayed below the node. Available for the following tags: image, audio, video, youtube_video, and table

    - New command line arguments:
        - Added command line arguments 'HTML_header' and 'HTML_footer' to the PML_to_HTML_Converter. Allows you to:
            - Provide a custom HTML header/footer for each document, or generate only the HTML body code (no header/footer).
            - Customize the style of the resulting HTML by providing your specific CSS file(s), in addition to PML's default CSS file, or as a replacement.

- Some minor bug fixes
