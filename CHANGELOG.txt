Version 1.3.0 2021-03-09
========================

- Backwards-incompatible changes:

    - The tag's open/close symbols have changed from {} to []
        Example:
        old version: {i great}
        new version: [i great]
        If you want to keep {} you can run the converter with the parameter --tag_start_stop_symbols "{}"

    - The open/close symbols for embedding variables have changed from [[]] to <<>>
        Example:
        old version: [[name]]
        new version: <<name>>

- New features:

    - A new CSS file, named pml-print-default.css, has been added.
      This file has specific styles defined for documents printed in a browser.
      These styles are also applied when a document is sent to a PDF writer, such as 'Microsoft Print to PDF' in Windows.
      You can use CSS's full printing support to adapt printed document to your specific needs,
      such as printing two columns on a page.

    - New attributes:
        - Tag 'document': attribute 'TOC_title' has been added.
          It defines the title displayed for the table of contents.
          The default value is "Table of Contents".

    - New command line arguments:
        - Argument 'tag_start_stop_symbols' has been added.
          It allows you to define which symbols you want to use to start/stop tags.
          Currently supported values are {} and []

- Improvements:

    - The Javascript code for expanding/collapsing the table of contents has been removed.
      The HTML <details> tag is used instead.

    - The Javascript code for sliding the separator between the table of contents and the text has been removed.


Version 1.2.0 2021-02-10
========================

- New features:

    - The PML_to_HTML_Converter is now open-sourced under the GPL 2.
    - Development is supported on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
    - Support for the Gradle build tool has been added.
    - The 'prism' source code syntax highlighter is now supported, as an alternative to 'lightjs'.
      Refer to the documentation of nodes 'document', 'code', and 'insert_code' for more information.


Version 1.1.0 2021-01-14
========================

- New features:

    - New tags:
        - table_data: Simple table data defined as plain CSV text, and rendered as a table.
        - table: A table layout composed of rows and columns.
          Besides just text, each cell in the table can have complex content, including nested tables.
          Conceptually similar to a HTML table.
        - monospace: A paragraph in which whitespace is preserved, and a monospace font is used.
        - division: A division or section in the document. Similar to a 'div' tag in HTML.
        - span: An inline node typically used to render a HTML <span>...</span> inline element with a specific set of
          HTML attributes.

    - New attributes:
        - caption: a small text displayed below the node. Available for the following tags:
          image, audio, video, youtube_video, and table

    - New command line arguments:
        - Added command line arguments 'HTML_header' and 'HTML_footer' to the PML_to_HTML_Converter. Allows you to:
            - Provide a custom HTML header/footer for each document, or generate only the HTML body code (no header/footer).
            - Customize the style of the resulting HTML by providing your specific CSS file(s), in addition to PML's
              default CSS file, or as a replacement.

- Some minor bug fixes
